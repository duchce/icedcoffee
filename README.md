Icedcoffee v0.7
===============

Icedcoffee is a lightweight framework for building stunning, accelerated 2D and 3D user interfaces
based on OpenGL ES 2. It is written in Objective-C and runs on iOS and Mac OS X. Among its most
notable features are: perspective UI rendering, sophisticated shader-based picking and hit tests,
full event handling for all drawable objects, buffering of views via OpenGL render textures, and
advanced font rendering and type setting using a crossover of CoreText and GL-backed glyph caches.

Icedcoffee essentially gives you full control of what's on the screen by unlocking the power
of graphics hardware without forcing you to deal with the details of OpenGL â€“ it's a perfect match
for every developer reaching the limits of UIKit and CoreAnimation.

Icedcoffee is designed to be clean, minimalistic, consistent and reusable for different purposes.
It may be used to build interfaces for games, full application frontends or to extend existing
applications with new OpenGL-based components such as infinitely scrollable views, animated
overlays, and so on. Icedcoffee emphasizes easy integration and doesn't hijack your application.
Promised!

Icedcoffee is open source and free for both non-commercial and commercial use (MIT license).

	Note: This is an early release, which means that some things aren't quite finished yet.


Getting Started
---------------

1. Pull the code from github: the easiest way to stay updated is to use *Git Read-only*
   by typing `git clone git://github.com/starbugs/icedcoffee.git` on the terminal.

2. Open `icedcoffee.xcworkspace` using Xcode 4.2 or newer.

3. Pick and run some of the tests and have fun!

Main Features
-------------

  * Minimalistic scene graph: scene node infrastructure with arbitrary 3D transforms,
    easily extensible via node visitation
  * Full event handling support for nodes, views and controls (multi-touch, mouse, keyboard),
    responder chain design similar to that found in Cocoa/CocoaTouch
  * Shader-based picking/selection of nodes (arbitrary picking shapes)
  * Render to texture, picking through (potentially nested) texture FBOs via unprojection
  * Render to texture and picking with depth and stencil buffer support
  * Scale9 sprites for scaling background images and sprite textures
  * Perspective UI rendering via UI cameras (XY world plane matches the screen plane)
  * View hierarchy with stencil-based clipping, optionally backed by render textures
  * Target-action control event handling for user interface controls
  * Font rendering via CoreText and OpenGL-backed glyph caches
  * Convienent texture caching, asynchronous texture loading via GCD using shared OpenGL contexts
  * Rendering via display link, dedicated thread or main thread
  * Retina display support for all suitable iOS devices
  * GPUImage integration for efficiently displaying and filtering camera inputs and movie files
  * View/view controller architecture for easy integration with Cocoa/CocoaTouch
  * Minimalistic design with little dependencies: very easy to integrate into existing
    OpenGL and non-OpenGL applications or games
