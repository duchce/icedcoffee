/**
 @brief A node that renders a sub-scene to a texture render target and displays the result
 using a built-in sprite
 
 <h3>Overview</h3>
 
 The ICRenderTexture class implements a mechanism for rendering a scene represented by an
 ICScene object into a framebuffer object (FBO) backed by a texture. The class comes with
 built-in support for depth and stencil buffer attachments to the FBO. It supports picking
 and event handling implicitly, i.e. all nodes added to the render texture's sub scene
 will be capable of picking and handling user interaction events automatically. The
 ICRenderTexture class furthermore allows for conditional ('on-demand') redrawing of its
 contents.
 
 <h3>Setup</h3>
 
 You set up an ICRenderTexture by initializing it with the desired size and, optionally,
 buffer formats. You then define the sub scene that presents the contents of the render texture.
 The render texture itself is finally added to a scene. It then automatically draws the contents
 defined in the sub scene to its texture and displays it using a built-in sprite.
 
 Example:
 @code
 // Initialize an autoreleased render texture object with a size of 320x240 points.
 // As we did not specify any buffer formats, the render texture will be created with a
 // default (RGBA8888) color buffer and no depth/stencil buffers.
 ICRenderTexture *myRenderTexture = [ICRenderTexture renderTextureWithWidth:320 height:240];
 
 // Now specify the scene the render texture should present on screen. We will just add an
 // examplary sprite to the scene here
 myRenderTexture.subScene = [ICScene sceneWithHostViewController:(self.hostViewController)];
 ICSprite *mySprite = [ICSprite spriteWithTexture:someTexture];
 [myRenderTexture.subScene addChild:mySprite];
 
 // Finally, add the render texture to our scene
 [self.scene addChild:myRenderTexture];
 @endcode
 
 @note The example above assumes that you have set up an ICTexture2D object named
 <code>someTexture</code>, that <code>self.hostViewController</code> is a valid reference
 to the host view controller used to present the scene and that <code>self.scene</code>
 is a reference to the scene the render texture should be added to as a child.
 
 <h3>Resizing</h3>
 
 You may resize an ICRenderTexture object by changing its ICRenderTexture::size property.
 The render texture will then re-create its internal buffers automatically.
 
 <h3>Conditional Drawing</h3>
 
 ICRenderTexture adds functionality for conditional drawing (framebuffer updates on demand only)
 to the icedcoffee scene graph. Conditional drawing can be configured using the
 ICRenderTexture::frameUpdateMode property. If ICRenderTexture::frameUpdateMode is set to
 <code>ICFrameUpdateModeOnDemand</code>, the visitation system will draw the sub scene of
 the render texture only if ICNode::setNeedsDisplay was called within the current run loop
 slice. If <code>frameUpdateMode</code> is set to <code>ICFrameUpdateModeSynchronized</code>,
 the framework will render the sub scene to the render texture on each time the parent
 scene is drawn.
 
 Note that by default render textures are initialized with
 <code>ICFrameUpdateModeSynchronized</code>. For sub scenes that do not change frequently,
 you should set the frame update mode to on demand drawing.
 
 @code
 // As the sprite we have added in the previous example isn't updated frequently, improve
 // rendering performance by only drawing it when really required:
 myRenderTexture.frameUpdateMode = ICFrameUpdateModeOnDemand;
 @endcode
 
 At a later point in your application code, when the render texture's contents are changed,
 you must call ICNode::setNeedsDisplay on the object that was changed. This tells the framework
 that the render texture's contents must be redrawn the next time its parent scene is rendered:
 
 @code
 // Assume we are at a position in your code where changing the position of the sprite in
 // the render texture's sub scene is required...
 
 // First, set the sprite's position:
 [mySprite setPositionX:10];
 
 // Now tell the framework to update the render texture's contents to reflect the sprite's
 // position change inside the render texture's framebuffer.
 [mySprite setNeedsDisplay];
 @endcode
 
 <h3>Nesting Render Textures</h3>
 
 ICRenderTexture objects may be nested in arbitrary sub scene graphs, which is particularly
 useful for implementing view hierarchies backed by OpenGL framebuffers. Nesting works out
 of the box, intuitively and without any further settings required:
 
 @code
 // Add a new render texture inside our existing one:
 ICRenderTexture *innerRenderTexture = [ICRenderTexture renderTextureWithWidth:120 height:20];
 [myRenderTexture addChild:innerRenderTexture];
 
 // Add contents to the inner render texture
 innerRenderTexture.subScene = [ICScene sceneWithHostViewController:self.hostViewController];
 ICSprite *anotherSprite = [ICSprite spriteWithTexture:anotherTexture];
 [innerRenderTexture addChild:anotherSprite];
 @endcode
 
 <h3>Depth and Stencil Buffers</h3>
 
 ICRenderTexture supports depth buffer and packed depth-stencil buffer attachments.
 There are a number of convenience initializers available you may use to create render
 textures with depth or depth-stencil buffer attachments:
 
 <ul>
    <li>ICRenderTexture::initWithWidth:height:depthBuffer: creates a default depth buffer
    attachment if depthBuffer is set to YES.</li>
    <li>ICRenderTexture::initWithWidth:height:depthBuffer:stencilBuffer: creates a default
    depth-stencil buffer if stencilBuffer is set to YES.</li>
    <li>ICRenderTexture::initWithWidth:height:pixelFormat:depthBufferFormat:stencilBufferFormat:
    allows you to exactly define the formats for each buffer.</li>
 </ul>
 
 Note that due to compatibility reasons, ICRenderTexture does only support stencil buffers
 as part of a packed depth-stencil buffer.
 
 <h3>Subclassing</h3>
 
 You may subclass ICRenderTexture to extend or customize the render texture's functionality.
 Subclasses providing customized initialization should override the
 ICRenderTexture::initWithWidth:height:pixelFormat:depthBufferFormat:stencilBufferFormat:
 method, which is the designated initializer of ICRenderTexture.
